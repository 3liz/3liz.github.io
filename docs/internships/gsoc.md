# Javascript refactoring in order to add code coverage.

Our current front-end code, mostly written ins Javascript is not easily testable. We would like to refactor 
this code and add has many tests as possible. You'll need to understand how Lizmap works in order to complete 
the subject. This is mostly about javascript, testing and tools to make it happen.

# Add SSO support 

We would like to have the ability to use lizmap with SSO providers like okta, Auth0 ...
This project is about working with our backend library Jelix ( see https://jelix.org) and our front-end code
in order to bring the code architecture to have the possibility to use SSO when connecting to lizmap.
This will require PHP and javascript skills. In order to make the necessary changes in our code base in order
to bring one provider and make it easy to add SSO providers.
